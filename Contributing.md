# Contributing guidelines

 - Be respectful, and polite to all the fellow contributors as well as to the collaborators.
 - In order to contribute, you can either create a new issue or ask to assign yourself an already existing one (if it is unassigned yet).
 - If you create your own issue, make sure to mention the **Type of issue** (bug fix, feature enhancement,etc), **how you plan** to resolve it, and alongwith that attach a **picture/screenshot** of the website with that issue addressed.
 - If you plan to work on an already existing issue, comment on it and also explain in 2-3 lines your approach of handling the issue.
 - Please note, copying already existing or completed issues will not be addressed.
 - Before you open a pull request, wait for the issue being assigned to you (this might take a while).
 - After you make a pull request, merging it might take a while, please be patient in that case, also the collaborator may ask you to make some changes.
 - In case you have already been assigned an issue, make sure you complete it **within 7 days** of it being assigned or otherwise it will be assigned to someone else.
 - Make sure to **follow** the **file structure** and to add your work accordingly.
 
# How to make Pull requests
*(This is extensively for those who are new to GitHub and open source)*
 - Fork the main repo, which basically means creating a new copy of it.
 - Clone your forked repo into your local : `git clone https://github.com/GURMEHAR-PEC/MERN-Templates` (assuming this is my cloned repo).
 - Make your changes/contributions.
 - Add the changes for staging - `git add {filename}` or `git add .`
 - Commit the changes `git commit -m "Add suitable commit message here"`
 - Push the changes into your forked repository : `git push`
 - Now go to your forked repository, and click on the `Contribute` button, after that click on `Open pull request`
 - Describe your work in the format mentioned above, and also make sure to mention the **issue number** .
 - After this you can submit your pull request.
 - PS : It is always advisable to *sync* your forked repo before you start contributing.
